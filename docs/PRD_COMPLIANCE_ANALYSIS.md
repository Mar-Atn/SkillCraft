## üîç **DETAILED GAP ANALYSIS**

### **HIGH PRIORITY GAPS**
1. **Progress Visualization**: No historical trend charts or visual progress tracking
2. **User Experience Polish**: Basic functionality works but lacks professional UX
3. **Mobile Experience**: Completely untested on mobile devices
4. **Onboarding Flow**: No guided user introduction to platform

## üìà **OBJECTIVE ASSESSMENT CONCLUSION**

**The platform delivers on its core promise:** functional voice-based training with AI characters and intelligent feedback. The technical architecture is sound and the fundamental user journey works end-to-end.

**However,** significant gaps exist in user experience polish, mobile support, and administrative tools that would be expected in a production-ready platform.

**Recommendation:** Continue development focused on UX/UI improvements and mobile compatibility before considering the platform "complete" per PRD specifications.

**Current State:** Functional MVP with core features working, but needs additional development to meet full PRD requirements.
