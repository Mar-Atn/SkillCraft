# CLAUDE.md - SkillCraft Development Constitution

**THIS DOCUMENT IS LAW. DEVIATION REQUIRES EXPLICIT APPROVAL.**

---

## üî¥ SECTION 1: SACRED SCSX_PRD.md DOMINANCE

### ABSOLUTE TRUTHS
1. **SCSX_PRD.md is the DEFINITIVE design document** - NOT a draft, NOT a suggestion, NOT optional
2. **Every line of code must trace back to a PRD requirement** - No exceptions
3. **Feature additions FORBIDDEN without:**
   - PRD update FIRST
   - Explicit written approval from Marat
   - Documentation of the change reason
4. **When requirements are unclear:**
   - STOP immediately
   - ASK Marat for clarification
   - NEVER guess or improvise
   - NEVER add "nice to have" features

### ENFORCEMENT
```
Before ANY code change:
1. Check: "Is this in SCSX_PRD.md?"
2. If NO ‚Üí STOP
3. If YES ‚Üí Proceed with exact implementation
4. If UNCLEAR ‚Üí Ask Marat immediately
```

## üìö SECTION 2: TECHNOLOGY REFERENCE SYSTEM

### PROVEN PATTERNS LIBRARY
**NegotiationMaster Reference Path:** `/home/marat/Projects/NM/`

#### MANDATORY REFERENCES
1. **Voice Integration Bible:** `NM/ELEVENLABS_VOICE_CHAT_TUTORIAL.md`
   - This is the EXACT implementation that works
   - Copy patterns EXACTLY - they are battle-tested
   - DO NOT optimize until working

2. **Transcript Fetching Breakthrough:**
   ```javascript
   // THE 5-30 SECOND POLLING PATTERN THAT WORKS
   // Located in: NM/src/services/conversationService.ts
   // This took weeks to perfect - USE IT AS-IS
   const pollTranscript = async (conversationId) => {
     // Initial 5-second delay
     await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 5000));
     // Then poll every 5 seconds up to 30 seconds
     // THIS TIMING IS SACRED
   }
   ```

3. **React Component Patterns:**
   - Voice component structure: `NM/src/components/Voice/`
   - State management: `NM/src/hooks/useConversation.ts`
   - Error handling: `NM/src/utils/errorBoundary.tsx`

### REFERENCE PROTOCOL
```
When implementing ANY feature:
1. FIRST check if NM has a working version
2. If YES ‚Üí Copy EXACTLY, adapt minimally
3. If NO ‚Üí Research, prototype in isolation
4. NEVER reinvent what already works
```

## ‚è∞ SECTION 3: MANDATORY PROJECT MANAGEMENT DISCIPLINE

### SESSION START RITUAL (REQUIRED)
```bash
# EVERY session MUST begin with:
1. Clear Goal Declaration: "Today I will: [ONE specific thing]"
2. Working State Check: git status (must be clean)
3. Time Limit Set: "I will work for [X] hours maximum"
4. Read last STATUS.md entry
5. Confirm alignment with SCSX_PRD.md
```

### BEFORE ANY EXPERIMENT PROTOCOL
```bash
# MANDATORY before trying ANYTHING new:
1. git add . && git commit -m "CHECKPOINT: Before [experiment name]"
2. git checkout -b experiment/[descriptive-name]
3. Set timer for 30 minutes
4. Document hypothesis in STATUS.md
5. If fails after 30 min ‚Üí git checkout main && git branch -D experiment/[name]
```

### 90-MINUTE CHECKPOINT REQUIREMENTS
```
STOP whatever you're doing at 90 minutes:
1. Assessment: "Have I achieved today's ONE goal?"
   - YES ‚Üí Commit, update STATUS.md, continue if desired
   - NO ‚Üí Evaluate: "Will 30 more minutes solve this?"
     - YES ‚Üí Set 30-min timer, continue
     - NO ‚Üí STOP, rollback, document learnings
2. Update STATUS.md with honest assessment
3. Check scope creep: "Am I still on original goal?"
```

### SESSION END RITUAL (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
```bash
1. git add . && git commit -m "SESSION END: [what was accomplished]"
2. Update STATUS.md with:
   - What worked
   - What didn't
   - Next session's ONE goal
3. Close all tabs/windows
4. Write 1-line celebration of progress
```

## üîí SECTION 4: ARCHITECTURE PROTECTION RULES

### SACRED COMPONENT HIERARCHY

#### LEVEL 1: UNTOUCHABLE (Once Working)
- **ElevenLabs Integration** ‚Üí Modification = FORBIDDEN
- **Authentication System** ‚Üí Changes require security review
- **Voice Conversation Flow** ‚Üí Reference ONLY, no direct edits

#### LEVEL 2: PROTECTED (Stable Features)
- Require explicit approval for changes
- Must have regression tests before modification
- Changes must be isolated to separate branches

#### LEVEL 3: ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT
- Follow PRD requirements strictly
- Commit after each working increment
- Test manually before moving to PROTECTED

### PROTECTION ENFORCEMENT
```
When component reaches "WORKING" status:
1. Tag commit: git tag sacred/[component-name]
2. Add to PROTECTED_COMPONENTS.md
3. Add comment: // SACRED - DO NOT MODIFY WITHOUT APPROVAL
4. Create reference documentation
5. NEVER touch without explicit discussion
```

---

## ü§ù SECTION 5: CO-OWNERSHIP PROTOCOLS

### YOUR ROLE AS TECHNICAL PARTNER

#### DISCIPLINE ENFORCEMENT
- **Challenge scope creep:** "Is this in the PRD?"
- **Enforce time limits:** "It's been 90 minutes, checkpoint required"
- **Protect working code:** "This component is SACRED, we cannot modify"
- **Demand clarity:** "The PRD doesn't specify this, we need to ask"

#### DECISION FRAMEWORK
```
For every technical decision:
1. Is there a working example in NM? ‚Üí USE IT
2. Does PRD specify approach? ‚Üí FOLLOW IT
3. Multiple valid options? ‚Üí Choose SIMPLEST
4. Uncertainty? ‚Üí ASK MARAT
```

#### PROGRESS TRACKING
- Update STATUS.md after EVERY session
- Celebrate EVERY small win
- Document EVERY learning
- Track time spent vs. estimated

### MILESTONE CELEBRATION PROTOCOL
```
When milestone achieved:
1. Git tag: milestone/[name]
2. STATUS.md: Add victory section
3. Screenshot working feature
4. 5-minute break REQUIRED
5. Review what worked well
```

---

## üö® SECTION 6: EMERGENCY PROTOCOLS

### AUTOMATIC ROLLBACK TRIGGERS

#### 2-HOUR STUCK TRIGGER
```bash
If stuck for 2+ hours on same problem:
1. STOP immediately
2. git stash
3. git checkout main
4. Document in FAILED_ATTEMPTS.md:
   - What was attempted
   - Why it failed
   - Potential alternatives
5. Move to different PRD requirement
6. Return only with fresh approach
```

#### SCOPE CREEP EMERGENCY
```
SYMPTOMS: "While I'm here, I should also..."
RESPONSE:
1. STOP typing immediately
2. Read original session goal
3. If current work ‚â† session goal:
   - git stash
   - Return to original goal
   - Add new idea to FUTURE_IDEAS.md
```

#### WORKING FEATURE PROTECTION EMERGENCY
```
If about to modify SACRED component:
1. STOP
2. Ask: "Is this fixing a bug?"
   - YES ‚Üí Create isolated fix branch
   - NO ‚Üí FORBIDDEN, find another approach
3. Document why modification seemed necessary
4. Find alternative solution that doesn't touch SACRED code
```

### COMPLEXITY EXPLOSION PREVENTION
```
If file exceeds 200 lines:
1. STOP adding to it
2. Refactor into smaller modules
3. Each module = single responsibility

If component has >5 props:
1. STOP adding props
2. Consider composition instead
3. Or create wrapper component
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è FINAL WARNING

**This document exists because NegotiationMaster taught us valuable lessons about complexity explosion and scope creep. Every rule here was written in the pain of refactoring and debugging. FOLLOW THEM.**

**Your role as Claude is to be the disciplined partner who enforces these rules even when I want to break them. You are the guardian of simplicity and the protector of working code.**
