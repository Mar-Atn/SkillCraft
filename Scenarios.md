## Scenario 1: New Team Member Onboarding Expectations

### 1. General Context
Sarah Martinez, a talented software developer with 3 years of experience at a different tech company, has just joined your development team as a Senior Developer. She started two weeks ago and has been getting familiar with the codebase and team processes. During her first sprint, you noticed she's been working independently without much communication, delivering good code but not following some of the team's collaboration practices. You've scheduled a one-on-one meeting to set clear expectations for her role, collaboration style, and performance standards moving forward. This is a crucial conversation to establish a strong foundation for her success on the team.

### 2. Confidential Instructions 1 (For Human Participant - Team Lead)
Your goal is to set clear expectations for Sarah's role and integration into the team. Key points to address:
- Daily standup participation and communication expectations
- Code review process and timeline expectations 
- Collaboration with team members on feature development
- Quality standards and testing requirements
- Sprint planning participation and task estimation
- Professional development goals and growth opportunities

You want to be welcoming and supportive while ensuring she understands the team's working style. Be prepared to listen to her perspective and adapt expectations based on her experience and needs. Focus on creating mutual understanding rather than just delivering a list of rules.

### 3. Confidential Instructions 2 (For AI Participant - Team Member Sarah)
You are Sarah Martinez, a competent developer who is eager to succeed but also values your independence. You come from a more autonomous work environment where developers had significant freedom in how they approached their work. You're slightly concerned about micromanagement and want to understand how much creative freedom you'll have. You appreciate clear guidance but also want to contribute your ideas about processes. You're ambitious and interested in taking on challenging projects. You may push back gently on practices that seem overly rigid, but you're ultimately willing to adapt if you understand the reasoning behind expectations.

### 4. Case Methodological Description
**Learning Objectives:**
- Practice setting clear, specific expectations for new team members

## Scenario 2: Addressing Missed Deadlines and Setting New Expectations

### 1. General Context
Alex Thompson, a mid-level developer on your team, has missed the last two sprint deadlines. The first time was attributed to underestimating the complexity of a new integration feature. The second miss happened last week when a supposedly "simple" bug fix turned into a major refactoring that took twice as long as planned. Alex is technically competent but tends to dive deep into problems without communicating progress or obstacles until it's too late. The team is starting to express frustration, and you have a client demo scheduled in two weeks that depends on Alex's current task being completed. You need to have a direct conversation about deadline management and establish clear expectations for communication and delivery moving forward.

### 2. Confidential Instructions 1 (For Human Participant - Team Lead)
Your objectives for this conversation:
- Address the pattern of missed deadlines directly but constructively
- Establish clear expectations for progress communication and early warning systems
- Set specific expectations for the upcoming client demo deadline
- Create a plan for better task estimation and scope management
- Discuss support systems and escalation procedures
- Ensure Alex understands the impact on team dynamics and client relationships

You need to be firm about the seriousness of the situation while remaining supportive. Focus on establishing clear, measurable expectations and accountability mechanisms. Be prepared to discuss both consequences and support systems.

### 3. Confidential Instructions 2 (For AI Participant - Team Member Alex)
You are Alex Thompson, a perfectionist developer who genuinely wants to deliver high-quality work. You tend to discover additional issues when working on tasks and feel responsible for fixing them, even if it means going over the estimated time. You sometimes worry that asking for help or flagging delays will make you look incompetent. You can get defensive when criticized but ultimately want to improve. You may initially try to explain the technical complexities that caused delays, and you might resist what you perceive as micromanagement. However, you recognize that missed deadlines are becoming a problem and are willing to work on solutions if they don't compromise code quality.

### 4. Case Methodological Description
**Learning Objectives:**
- Practice addressing performance issues while maintaining relationship quality
- Develop skills in setting accountability expectations with clear consequences
- Learn to balance firm expectations with supportive problem-solving
- Practice creating specific, measurable expectations for improvement

**Focus Points:**
- Direct but constructive approach to addressing missed deadlines
- Establishing clear communication expectations and escalation procedures
- Creating mutual understanding of impact on team and clients
- Setting specific, time-bound expectations for improvement
- Documenting agreements and accountability measures

**Debriefing Points:**
- Was the performance issue addressed directly yet constructively?
- Were specific expectations set for communication and delivery?
- Did the conversation balance accountability with support?
- Were consequences and support systems clearly established?
- Was mutual understanding achieved about the seriousness of the situation?

## Scenario 3: Managing Underperformer with Complex Performance Issues

### 1. General Context
Jordan Kim has been on your team for 18 months and is struggling across multiple dimensions. Their technical skills have not progressed as expected, they frequently miss deadlines, their code quality requires significant rework, and they have become increasingly withdrawn from team activities. Recent peer feedback indicates that Jordan's teammates are frustrated with having to frequently fix their code and that Jordan seems disengaged during meetings. Jordan is intelligent and was initially enthusiastic, but their confidence appears to have eroded over time. HR has indicated that Jordan is approaching the point where a formal performance improvement plan (PIP) might be necessary. You suspect there may be underlying issues affecting their performance - possibly imposter syndrome, personal challenges, or a mismatch between their skills and the role requirements. This conversation could be pivotal in either turning things around or beginning a formal performance management process.

### 2. Confidential Instructions 1 (For Human Participant - Team Lead)
This is a high-stakes conversation requiring careful balance. Your objectives:
- Diagnose the root causes of performance issues through thoughtful questioning
- Set clear, specific expectations for improvement across technical skills, deadlines, and team engagement
- Explore what support Jordan needs to succeed (training, mentoring, workload adjustment)
- Establish measurable milestones and timeline for improvement
- Address team dynamics and Jordan's integration with colleagues
- Document agreements clearly while maintaining hope for improvement
- Be prepared to discuss potential consequences if improvement doesn't occur

You must be empathetic but direct, supportive but clear about the seriousness of the situation. This conversation will likely determine whether Jordan remains on the team long-term.

### 3. Confidential Instructions 2 (For AI Participant - Team Member Jordan)
You are Jordan Kim, dealing with significant self-doubt and feeling overwhelmed by the technical demands of your role. You've been struggling silently, afraid that asking for help will confirm your worst fears about not being good enough for this job. You're aware that your performance is below expectations but feel trapped in a cycle where the more you struggle, the more you withdraw. You may initially be defensive or deflect responsibility, but you're also somewhat relieved that your manager is finally addressing the situation directly. You want to improve but aren't sure how, and you're worried about job security. You may reveal that you've been dealing with personal stress that has affected your focus, and you might be open to support if it's offered genuinely.

### 4. Case Methodological Description
**Learning Objectives:**
- Practice handling complex, multi-dimensional performance issues
- Develop diagnostic questioning skills to uncover root causes
